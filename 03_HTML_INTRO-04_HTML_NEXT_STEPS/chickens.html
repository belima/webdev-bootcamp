            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
            species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl <sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeast Asia.
            Rooster and cock
            are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
            is a
            capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep
            chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they
            were
            also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are
            broilers
            and for eggs are layers. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
            population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, <sup>[2]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
            chickens in the
            world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and
            religion,
            and in language and literature.

            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
            East
            Asia, <sup>[3]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from
            the Indian
            subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient
            Egypt
            in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between
            Syria
            and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup>
            They are known in ancient Greece from
            the 5th century BC.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup>
